This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL: an incomplete sensitivity list in a process.  The original code (bug.vhd) misses a signal in the sensitivity list causing the process to not update correctly. The corrected code (bugSolution.vhd) shows how to fix this by adding the missing signal to the sensitivity list.  This ensures the process reacts to changes in the signal, even if they occur outside the process itself. This example highlights the importance of carefully defining the sensitivity list to avoid race conditions and ensure proper process execution.
